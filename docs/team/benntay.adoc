Our users interact via CLI and GUI created with JavaFX. Written in Java, experience what many are enjoying.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Meal Planner component.*
** What it does: Allows users to add their desired recipes to a calendar so that they can plan their meals for each day's meals.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only browse recipes, but also keep a record of the recipes they want to try on which specific days.
** Highlights: This enhancement was originally unsupported by the AB4 code, and a new separate data structure had to be implemented.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

*To be updated*
